# vBulletin - Show full links
Reveals truncated (...) links in vBulletin-forums. Works on other sites too, but be careful: i don't recommend to include "*"! 

The script checks url and link description. If both parts of description (splitted by "...") are part of the url, the truncated description will be replaced by the url.

## More Information
Visit [this thread in official vBulletin forum](http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=153794) and have a look at link after "More information might be posted at vBulletin.com:". Without this script the following link will be truncated and shown as:

   http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showt...28#post1399028

With this script the full url is visible:

   http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1399028#post1399028

Other sites (you have to append appropriate @include-rules) where this script could change link descriptions:
